# Causality in Configurable Software Systems - Supplementary Material

We provide the prototype implementation of FeatCause alongside with the data to reproduce the experiments from our evaluation.

Additionally, we provide an **appendix.pdf** that contains proofs and additional connections we explored but had to be omitted from the main paper due to space constraints.

In order to reduce the trouble with dependencies, we provide a [Virtual Machine]() which has all python requirements installed and contains a working binary of [espresso](https://github.com/psksvp/espresso-ab-1.0).

## Directory structure
The supplementary material to reproduce our findings from the evaluation is organized in the following three main directories:

### tool
In this directory, we provide the prototype of **FeatCause**, our algorithm to compute feature causes.

- _main.py_ contains the major part of the implementation
- *fm\_parser.py*, *causality.py*, *utils.py* contain helping functionality for **FeatCause**
- *espresso*, *espresso-osx* are precompiled binaries of the two-level minimizer **espresso** for Linux and macos operating systems (main.py invokes "espresso", please rename the file accordingly when on a macos system -- for Windows users, please compile [espresso](https://github.com/psksvp/espresso-ab-1.0) by your own)


#### _main.py_
To run our prototype the first argument needs to be the path to the experiment + experiment name, e.g., 'python3 main.py experiment/expFolder/expName ... '.

One can choose between different options to run our prototype:
 - _-s_ [number] the number of the single effect experiment to be considered, default is set to **-1**, which includes all effect experiments
 - _-fmt_ [DNF, CNF] determins the format of the feature model and effect set, default is set to **DNF**
 - _-n_ switches the effect set and its negation
 - _-na_ disables feature cause computation (only compute cause-effect covers)

 - _-d_ minimize causes with the distributive law simplification
 - _-m_ computes most general feature causes
 - _-e_ [standard, fast] adds the output minimal cause-effect covers generated by espresso
 - _-b_ [pfblame, fblame, cblame, all] determins which blame shall be computed, pfblame for the blame of partial configurations, fblame for the blame of single features, and cblame for the blame of causes
 - _-w_ computes the weights of causes
 - _-i_ enables computation of minimal t-way interaction witnesses

 - _-sani_ performs sanity checks during computation

 - _-v_ is the verbose flag, leading to more output information about each experiment
 - _-p_ to print all feature cause results on std::out
 - _-stat_ writes statistics for the descriptive statistics table
 - _-tstat_ adds the time to compute feature causes to existing statistic files


### scripts
 - *profeat\_extract.py* is a script to extract the experiments from the ProFeat model checking results.
 - *provelines\_extract.py* is a script to extract the experiments from the ProVeLines model checking results.
 - *buildEvaluationTable.py* is a script to create a table for descriptive statistics of all experiments (as presented in the paper)

### benchmark
Contains a script (_evaluation\_runner.py_) to execute all experimentes as well as an archive of examples (_examples.zip_) which contains all data that are used in the paper to evaluate our approach.

Flags for *evaluation_runner.py*:
 - _-c_ to check if all experiments are found.
 - _-r_ to run all experiments
 - _-t_ to get run time measurements for all experiments, can only be used after running all experiments once
 - _-m_ to run multiple experiments in parallel, one for each thread of the system

To execute the runner, espresso has to be located in the same directory as the *evaluation_runner.py*.
**Make sure to unzip *examples.zip*** before you run the *evaluation_runner.py*.

## Requirements

### espresso
We provide binaries of espresso compiled for macos and Linux, compiled from the following [sources](https://github.com/psksvp/espresso-ab-1.0)

### Python
To run our prototype the following dependencies need to be provided, which are installable in the standard way via pip:
 - pyeda
 - pandas

## Creating own Case-Studies
To compute causes, responsibility and blame for your own case study, you need to provide the following files:
 - _study.fs_ contains all features of the case study, each feature in an own line
 - _study.fm_ contains a feature model (formula of all valid configurations) in **DNF** or **CNF** format, where each line represents one clause
 - _study.0_  contains the set of configurations, for which a certain effect property can be observed, also in **DNF** or **CNF** format, where each line represents one clause

**Note:** All files have to be stored in the same directory, with the same file name and their respective, correct file extension. If you want conduct more than one experiment for a system,
you can add more than one effect set, by increasing the file extension, e.g., _study.1_ would be the second effect set for this system.
If you use **CNF** format, you have to specify the option _-fmt CNF_, you have to use the same format for all effect sets and the feature model of one case study.

## Experiment Results
The results of our tool will be written in a new directory, i.e., _tmp_, in the same directory as the tool.
Causes and blame are stored in subdirectories of _tmp_, for which their experiment name is used as name.
All statistical output, i.e., produced with the flags _-stat_ and _-tstat_, will be in a subdirectory of _tmp_, i.e., *statistic_files*.


## Example
Executing the command `python main.py examples/RWSPL/lrzip/lrzipPaper -i -b all -m -d -sani -s 1 -p -w` leads to the output:
